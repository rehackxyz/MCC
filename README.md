# Malaysia Cybersecurity Camp (MCC)
MCC is a 4-days and 3-nights 'summer' camp organised by RE:HACK and Nanosec Asia focusing on cybersecurity topics for students and beginners in Malaysia. Our objectives are simple but impactful to the industry:
* Identifying local unicorns
* Increase their knowledge through expert-led bootcamps/trainings as well as get to know experts within the field
* To bridge the skills divide between professionals and learners.
* To bring them up to par with other talented students worldwide
* To produce quality graduates ready to enter the workforce with minimal training
